# FilmKepeer 
Created a comprehensive backend system designed to manage movie-related data, including movies, actors, genres, producers, and user reviews. Built using ASP.NET Core and MySQL, this project follows the REST API architecture, allowing smooth and efficient handling of CRUD operations. The system is structured with a service and repository layer, ensuring modularity, scalability, and clean code practices. Through well-designed endpoints, users can fetch movie details, add new entries, and update existing records with data validation and error handling. The project demonstrates advanced backend development skills, focusing on high performance and maintainability for large datasets in real-world movie applications.
